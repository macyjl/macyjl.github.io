		<h2>Tortoises</h2>
			<p> I have a female Russian Tortoise named Frankie, since I have a Russian Tortoises, they're my favorite kind. I also like the giant desert tortoises although they seem like they would be hard to handle, especially if they need to be moved. Russian Tortoises don't prefer to be touched so you just have to feed them and keep their habitat warm and humid.</p>

		<h2>Dogs</h2>
			<p> My family has had many dogs, but the two I remember are Polar and Tank. Polar was a large, german shepherd with all white fur. He had to be put down a few years ago because he had something wrong with his hip and he was suffering. Tank was a larger than average sized chihuahua with light brown fur. Tank died just last summer. My favorite breeds of dogs are the either really large dogs or the really small ones. I absolutely love Huskies, Pugs, Pomeranians, Saint Bernards, Newfoundlands, and Leonbergers which are a cross breed of Newfoundlands and Saint Bernards.</p>
