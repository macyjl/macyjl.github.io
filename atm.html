		<h2>Reflection of the program</h2>
			<p>I absolutely love the ATM program, when I applied for it while applying for middle school I honestly didn't know what it was all my mom told me was that it had to do with computers and I instantly wanted to do it. Although my mom wanted my to go with the wheel, where you have a different elective each semester including; computers, art, PE extension, or teacher's aid. I learned so much in ATM and my teachers taught me many useful skills, many of them that I will need in the future. ATM has put me ahead of my peers in so many ways. Just one example is of how quickly I get work done when it has to do with typing because I have excelled in typing thanks to the ATM program. Almost any job I would want to apply for, the fact that I have knowledge of computers will help me tremendously. Not to mention, ATM is also incredibly important in this day and age because technology is everywhere, everyone has a phone and most people have laptops or pcs. So the fact that I've gotten to learn so much about computers and I got to learn about a variety of programs having to do with computers such as Photoshop, Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, Microsoft Excel, Illustrator, SketchUp, Floorplanner, and Visual Studio Code, is amazing.</p>
