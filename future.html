		<h1> <strong>My Future</strong></h1>
		
		<h2>High School</h2>
			<p> For High School, I will be attending Lakewood High School, in the Odyssey program which has a focus or marine studies. During high school, I will try to get as many collge credits as I can, and will try to do volunteer work. When my oldest sister was in high school she volunteered at the Red Cross, so I may try and volunteer there.</p>

		<h2>College</h2>
			<p>As I'm only in middle school, I really haven't thought much about college, my oldest sister goes to UCSD, but I may look into Cal State, or Berkeley.</p>

		<h2>Career Interests</h2>
			<p>I have quite a few career interests. I'm interested in Engineering. I also am interested in being an Astrophysicis. Or maybe even a Physician's Assistant with a specialty in Pediatrics. For career interests, I usually like the science and math fields as I excel and enjoy both subjects.</p>

		<h2>My Goals</h2>
			<p>My goals are pretty simple. Right now, I want to secure my 4.0 GPA. I want to do good in high school and achieve grades of A's and B's. Then I want to get into a good college. After I get out of college I want to find a job and that's really about it.</p>
